# Data Structures -  Binary Search Tree (BST) 

In this project Binary Source Tree (BST) is implemented in C++ language. The purpose of the implementation is to read a text file that contains information about the students as shown below into a BST of Student objects. The comparison of student objects is done according to their grades, the last column of the file. There may be some duplicate grades so that the BST ignores them as shown in sample run. Then, print the
BST postorder traversal.
